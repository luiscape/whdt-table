Notes
-----
- The indicator `SP.POP.DDAY.TO` / "Number of people living on less than $1.25 a day (PPP)" seems to have been deprecated by the World Bank. Could not find it in their database.
- Could not find the indicator `Proportion of the population affected annually by natural disasters (10 years average %)` in the EM-DAT database. Is it a transformation? Added the indicator `Impact of natural disasters/ population affected (average per year-million)` from UNDP instead.
- Could nt find the indicator `Government revenues per capita (US$)` on the World Bank database. Nor anywhere else for that matter.
